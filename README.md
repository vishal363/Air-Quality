Project Overview:
This project involved the development of a comprehensive analysis of air quality in Delhi, India, leveraging data-driven insights to understand and forecast pollution levels. The objective was to calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI) using hourly pollutant data and predict future AQI values with high accuracy.

Key Features:

AQI Calculation Algorithm: Developed an algorithm to compute AQI based on hourly pollutant values, aligning with established air quality standards.

Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough preprocessing of the dataset and EDA to uncover underlying patterns and relationships between pollutants.

Predictive Modeling: Implemented a Random Forest Regressor model to predict AQI, taking advantage of the insights gained from EDA.

Model Evaluation: Validated the model's performance on unseen data, achieving an 82% accuracy rate, demonstrating the model's robustness and applicability.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning

Reflections:
This project not only provided a detailed understanding of air quality trends in Delhi but also highlighted the severity of pollution problems in the city. The developed predictive model stands as a testament to the power of machine learning in environmental studies, offering a robust tool for forecasting and planning.

I developed an algorithm to compute the Air Quality Index (AQI) using hourly pollutant data, aligning with standard guidelines to categorize air quality. Leveraging insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and thorough dataset preprocessing, I built a predictive model using the Random Forest Regressor. This model, rigorously tested on new data, achieved an impressive 84.13% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and reliability in forecasting AQI.
