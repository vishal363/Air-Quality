I developed an algorithm to compute the Air Quality Index (AQI) using hourly pollutant data, aligning with standard guidelines to categorize air quality. Leveraging insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and thorough dataset preprocessing, I built a predictive model using the Random Forest Regressor. This model, rigorously tested on new data, achieved an impressive 84.13% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and reliability in forecasting AQI.
